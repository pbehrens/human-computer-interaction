I am selling my virtually new MacBook Pro. I have had it for about 2 weeks and decided that I would rather have a MacBook Air.

It has been customized, but is still under warranty.

Right now there is an 80GB solid state drive installed that contains the operating system files. Then in place of the CD drive, there is a 500 Gb hard drive. 

I maxed out the RAM with 16GB of top of the line Corsair memory. 

There is not cosmetic damage that I can see. The sticker you see on it in the photos will be removed when I get the correct cleaning supplies.


If you have any questions feel free to ask me.
